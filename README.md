# singularity-containers
A place to keep my Singularity recipes.
This repository contains recipes in the format "Singularity.[program]" and was linked to Singularity Hub so that all commits would trigger builds there.  
Since Singularity Hub is no longer automatically building, new commits are no longer built.
